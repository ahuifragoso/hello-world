Just Another Repository

Allô!!!!!
Hello!!!!!
Hola!!!!
今日は

My name is Marcos but my friends calls me "Ahui", I am a Mexican Engineer graduated from the IPN.

I am really interested in Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous systems, vehicles, and fly.

I want to use GitHub to share some of my projects and make them reachable for most of the people.

I am really glad that you took the time to check this repository.

I am really interested in Anime, Manga, Science Fiction, books, movies, etc., so must of my projects might be inspired on this kind of media.

Regards,
